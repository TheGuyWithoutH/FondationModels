    "## 2 Training nanoMaskGIT on MNIST for image generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will implement a simplified masked generative model, similar to [MaskGIT](https://masked-generative-image-transformer.github.io/). \n",
    "As with our nanoGPT implementation, we will train it on MNIST for image generation, but will also later explore using it for text generation on TinyStories!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Masked modeling - Training objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to autoregressive models that are trained to predict the next token given the context so far, masked generative models like MaskGIT are trained to predict any (masked-out) token given any other (non-masked) subset of tokens.\n",
    "Consider the following example: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Sentence:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Masked Training Example (cloze):**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The quick [MASK] fox jumps over the [MASK] dog.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "The model must predict:\n",
    "- `[MASK]` → \"brown\"\n",
    "- `[MASK]` → \"lazy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeatedly training the model to predict these randomly masked tokens across a large dataset, MaskGIT learns how tokens fit contextually within sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Masked modeling - Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By training a model with randomized masking ratios, we are able to use it to progressively \"unmask\" a fully masked initial sequence.\n",
    "At inference, the model starts with all tokens masked and progressively unmasks tokens in multiple steps. Let's show an inference example generating two (`k=2`) tokens at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Masked Sequence:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"[MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step Generation (k=2 tokens at a time):**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] dog.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2:** (unmask next 2 most confident tokens)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The quick [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] lazy dog.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3:** (unmask next 2 tokens)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The quick [MASK] fox [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] lazy dog.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4:** (unmask next 2 tokens)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The quick brown fox jumps [MASK] the lazy dog.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 5 (Final):** (all tokens unmasked)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At each inference step, MaskGIT predicts all masked-out tokens simultaneously (in parallel), and, based on the predicted probabilites, selects the `k` (here `k=2`) most likely tokens. \n",
    "After deciding on which tokens to use, we sample a token index from the predicted probability distribution for each token, and add the tokens to the sequence. \n",
    "This, now slightly less masked, sequence is then used as the input for the next round, where again, the `k=2` most confident tokens are chosen of the remaining masked targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial difference of masked models to next-token prediction is that at each inference step we can freely choose the number of tokens `k` to simultaneously decode. \n",
    "Depending on the choice of `k`, this can speed up inference significantly, at little cost to generation performance. \n",
    "For example, see the comparison between raster-scan autoregressive, and masked generation below.\n",
    "Each frame of the gif is one generation step. Autoregressive generation predicts each token one-by-one, while masked models may predict them in parallel.\n",

    "\n",

    "3. To indicate masked-out tokens and provide placeholders to write the targets, initialize `self.mask_token` as an `nn.Parameter` containing a randomly initialized Tensor of shape (`dim`).\n",
    "4. This then gets passed to a Transformer trunk. Initialize `self.trunk` with the trunk you implemented last week.\n",
    "5. Finally we project the trunk output through a LayerNorm and output projection that maps the elements from the Transformer dimension to the vocabulary size (as a one-hot vector per token). Initialize `self.out_norm` and `self.to_logits`. The bias term for `self.to_logits` should always be set to False."

    "#### 2.1.4 MaskGIT schedule and generation function (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's implement the generation function. We do that in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's implement a so-called generation schedule in `get_maskgit_schedule`. \n",
    "Its task is to give us a list of number of tokens to unmask at every prediction step. \n",
    "It's quite common to make this a cosine schedule, i.e. where the tokens are unmasked slowly at the beginning, then in the middle many tokens are predicted at once, and finally in the end we ramp down again.\n",
    "Here we will implement a much simpler constant schedule, where the number of unmasked tokens per step is constant.\n",
    "For example, if total_tokens = 17 and num_steps = 8, then the schedule should be: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]. \n",
    "If the total number of tokens is not divisible by the number of steps, we simply add the remainder to the last step.\n",
    "The `schedule` should be a list of integers of length `num_steps`, where each integer represents the number of tokens to unmask at that step. \n",
    "The sum of the integers in `schedule` should equal `total_tokens`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the simple schedule implemented, let's use it in the `generate` function. Generation is performed in a loop in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Given the sequence and mask so far, simply pass them through the network to get the logits.\n",
    "2. Then, select the subset of logits that we actually want to predict, i.e. the masked-out tokens.\n",
    "3. Over all these predicted tokens, we only want to keep the most \"confident\" predictions. We select for these by computing the maximum logit value for each token as a proxy. The higher the maximum logit is for a given token, the more \"confident\" it is in its prediction.\n",
    "4. Now, let's select the top-k tokens according to these confidence scores. You get the number of tokens `k` from the generation schedule.\n",
    "5. Sample the token indices from these `k` selected token logits. You should use the `sample_tokens` function from `utils/sampling.py`, and remember to pass the relevant sampling hyperparameters.\n",
    "6. Update the sequence and mask for the next round using the newly sampled tokens and their positions.\n",
    "7. Repeat until the end of the generation schedule, when the sequence is fully unmasked."
